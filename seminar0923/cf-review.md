This paper presents a first look into the SSP blackhat SEO infrastructure. In doing so, the paper implements a DNS scanner to probe all domains they collect. It offers some novel and interesting measurements.

1. First, the adversaries prefer to assign a large number of SEO domains to certain ASs, and, most of the SEO domains are offered by a small amount of registrars. That is, spider pool owners usually recruit many new and expiring domains to build up their infrastructures. 
2. Second, it largely differs between spider pools in terms of the number of used SEO domains, varying from 100 to 1933. 
3. Third, the goals of the customers are mainly to promote their illegal business without unveiling traces to local legal authorities. That is, the customers do not deliver malware or phishing content.
4. Finally, the SSP can effectively manipulate the search results by increasing the visiting frequency from search crawlers.

The results are useful. The direct takeway is to help Baidu clean the search results and mitigate the threat. Besides, the search engine can refrain from crawling and indexing pages under SEO domains.

Finally, SSP can update their infrastructures for evasion knowing these detection algorithms.
