1. [ ] Xurong, Anatomization and Protection of Mobile Apps? Location Privacy Threats

Abstract: Mobile users are becoming increasingly aware of the privacy threats resulting from apps? access of their location. Few of the solutions proposed thus far to mitigate these threats have been deployed as they require either app or platform modifications. Mobile operating systems (OSes) also provide users with location access controls. In this paper, we analyze the efficacy of these controls in combating the location-privacy threats. For this analysis, we conducted the first location measurement campaign of its kind, analyzing more than 1000 free apps from Google Play and collecting detailed usage of location by more than 400 location-aware apps and 70 Advertisement and Analytics (A&A) libraries from more than 100 participants over a period ranging from 1 week to 1 year. Surprisingly, 70\% of the apps and the A&A libraries pose considerable profiling threats even when they sporadically access the user?s location. Existing OS controls are found ineffective and inefficient in mitigating these threats, thus calling for a finer-grained location access control. To meet this need, we propose LP-Doctor, a light-weight user-level tool that allows Android users to effectively utilize the OS?s location access controls while maintaining the required app?s functionality as our user study (with 227 participants) shows

Abstract: 
Single root I/O virtualization (SRIOV) is a hardware/ software interface that allows devices to “self virtualize” and thereby remove the host from the critical I/O path. SRIOV thus brings near bare-metal performance to untrusted guest virtual machines (VMs) in public clouds, enterprise data centers, and high-performance computing setups. We identify a design flaw in current Ethernet SRIOV NIC deployments that enables untrusted VMs to completely control the throughput and latency of other, unrelated VMs. The attack exploits Ethernet ”pause” frames, which enable network flow control functionality. We experimentally launch the attack across several NIC models and find that it is effective and highly accurate, with substantial consequences if left unmitigated: (1) to be safe, NIC vendors will have to modify their NICs so as to filter pause frames originating from SRIOV instances; (2) in the meantime, administrators will have to either trust their VMs, or configure their switches to ignore pause frames, thus relinquishing flow control, which might severely degrade networking performance. We present the Virtualization-Aware Network Flow Controller (VANFC), a software-based SRIOV NIC prototype that overcomes the attack. VANFC filters pause frames from malicious virtual machines without any loss of performance, while keeping SRIOV and Ethernet flow control hardware/software interfaces intact.

5. [ ] Changting, Bohatei: Flexible and Elastic DDoS Defense

Abstract: DDoS defense today relies on expensive and propri- etary hardware appliances deployed at fixed locations. This introduces key limitations with respect to flexibil- ity (e.g., complex routing to get traffic to these “choke- points”) and elasticity in handling changing attack pat- terns. We observe an opportunity to address these limita- tions using new networking paradigms such as software- defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtu- alization (NFV). Based on this observation, we design and implement Bohatei, a flexible and elastic DDoS de- fense system. In designing Bohatei, we address key challenges with respect to scalability, responsiveness, and adversary-resilience. We have implemented de- fenses for several DDoS attacks using Bohatei. Our evaluations show that Bohatei is scalable (handling 500 Gbps attacks), responsive (mitigating attacks within one minute), and resilient to dynamic adversaries.
