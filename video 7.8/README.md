1. [ ] Xurong, Anatomization and Protection of Mobile Apps? Location Privacy Threats

Abstract: Mobile users are becoming increasingly aware of the privacy threats resulting from apps? access of their location. Few of the solutions proposed thus far to mitigate these threats have been deployed as they require either app or platform modifications. Mobile operating systems (OSes) also provide users with location access controls. In this paper, we analyze the efficacy of these controls in combating the location-privacy threats. For this analysis, we conducted the first location measurement campaign of its kind, analyzing more than 1000 free apps from Google Play and collecting detailed usage of location by more than 400 location-aware apps and 70 Advertisement and Analytics (A&A) libraries from more than 100 participants over a period ranging from 1 week to 1 year. Surprisingly, 70\% of the apps and the A&A libraries pose considerable profiling threats even when they sporadically access the user?s location. Existing OS controls are found ineffective and inefficient in mitigating these threats, thus calling for a finer-grained location access control. To meet this need, we propose LP-Doctor, a light-weight user-level tool that allows Android users to effectively utilize the OS?s location access controls while maintaining the required app?s functionality as our user study (with 227 participants) shows

5. [ ] Changting, Bohatei: Flexible and Elastic DDoS Defense

Abstract: DDoS defense today relies on expensive and propri- etary hardware appliances deployed at fixed locations. This introduces key limitations with respect to flexibil- ity (e.g., complex routing to get traffic to these “choke- points”) and elasticity in handling changing attack pat- terns. We observe an opportunity to address these limita- tions using new networking paradigms such as software- defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtu- alization (NFV). Based on this observation, we design and implement Bohatei, a flexible and elastic DDoS de- fense system. In designing Bohatei, we address key challenges with respect to scalability, responsiveness, and adversary-resilience. We have implemented de- fenses for several DDoS attacks using Bohatei. Our evaluations show that Bohatei is scalable (handling 500 Gbps attacks), responsive (mitigating attacks within one minute), and resilient to dynamic adversaries.
