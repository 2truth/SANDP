1. [ ] Xurong, SecGraph: A Uniform and Open-source Evaluation System for Graph Data
Anonymization and De-anonymization

In this paper, we analyze and systematize the state-ofthe- art graph data privacy and utility techniques. Specifically, we propose and develop SecGraph (available at [1]), a uniform and open-source Secure Graph data sharing/publishing system. In SecGraph, we systematically study, implement, and evaluate 11 graph data anonymization algorithms, 19 data utility metrics, and 15 modern Structure-based De-Anonymization (SDA) attacks. To the best of our knowledge, SecGraph is the first such system that enables data owners to anonymize data by state-of-the-art anonymization techniques, measure the data?s utility, and evaluate the data?s vulnerability against modern De-Anonymization (DA) attacks. In addition, SecGraph enables researchers to conduct fair analysis and evaluation of existing and newly developed anonymization/DA techniques. Leveraging SecGraph, we conduct extensive experiments to systematically evaluate the existing graph data anonymization and DA techniques. The results demonstrate that (i) most anonymization schemes can partially or conditionally preserve most graph utilities while losing some application utility; (ii) no DA attack is optimum in all scenarios. The DA performance depends on several factors, e.g., similarity between anonymized and auxiliary data, graph density, and DA heuristics; and (iii) all the state-of-the-art anonymization schemes are vulnerable to several or all of the modern SDA attacks. The degree of vulnerability of each anonymization scheme depends on how much and which data utility it preserves.

3. [ ] Jianyu, M2R: Enabling Stronger Privacy in MapReduce Computation

New big-data analysis platforms can enable distributed computation on encrypted data by utilizing trusted computing primitives available in commodity server hardware. We study techniques for ensuring privacy preserving computation in the popular MapReduce framework. In this paper, we first show that protecting only individual units of distributed computation (e.g. map and reduce units), as proposed in recent works, leaves several important channels of information leakage exposed to the adversary. Next, we analyze a variety of design choices in achieving a stronger notion of private execution that is the analogue of using a distributed oblivious-RAM (ORAM) across the platform. We develop a simple solution which avoids using the expensive ORAM construction, and incurs only an additive logarithmic factor of overhead to the latency. We implement our solution in a system called M2R, which enhances an existing Hadoop implementation, and evaluate it on seven standard MapReduce benchmarks. We show that it is easy to port most existing applications to M2R by changing fewer than 43 lines of code. M2R adds fewer than 500 lines of code to the TCB, which is less than 0:16% of the Hadoop codebase. M2R offers a factor of 1:3x to 44:6x lower overhead than extensions of previous solutions with equivalent privacy. M2R adds a total of 17% to 130% overhead over the insecure baseline solution that ignores the leakage channels M2R addresses.


4. [ ] Kai, Marionette: A Programmable Network Traffic Obfuscation System

Recently, a number of obfuscation systems have been developed to aid in censorship circumvention scenarios where encrypted network traffic is filtered. In this paper, we present Marionette, the first programmable network traffic obfuscation system capable of simultaneously controlling encrypted traffic features at a variety of levels, including ciphertext formats, stateful protocol semantics, and statistical properties. The behavior of the system is directed by a powerful type of probabilistic automata and specified in a user-friendly domain-specific language, which allows the user to easily adjust their obfuscation strategy to meet the unique needs of their network environment. In fact, the Marionette system is capable of emulating many existing obfuscation systems, and enables developers to explore a breadth of protocols and depth of traffic features that have, so far, been unattainable. We evaluate Marionette through a series of case studies inspired by censor capabilities demonstrated in the real-world and research literature, including passive network monitors, stateful proxies, and active probing. The results of our experiments not only show that Marionette provides outstanding flexibility and control over traffic features, but it is also capable of achieving throughput of up to 6:7Mbps when generating RFCcompliant cover traffic.

5. [ ] Changting, "Control-Flow Bending: On the Effectiveness of Control-Flow Integrity"

Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) is a defense which pre- vents control-flow hijacking attacks. While recent re- search has shown that coarse-grained CFI does not stop attacks, fine-grained CFI is believed to be secure. 
We argue that assessing the effectiveness of practi- cal CFI implementations is non-trivial and that common evaluation metrics fail to do so. We then evaluate fully- precise static CFI — the most restrictive CFI policy that does not break functionality — and reveal limitations in its security. Using a generalization of non-control-data attacks which we call Control-Flow Bending (CFB), we show how an attacker can leverage a memory corruption vulnerability to achieve Turing-complete computation on memory using just calls to the standard library. We use this attack technique to evaluate fully-precise static CFI on six real binaries and show that in five out of six cases, powerful attacks are still possible. Our results suggest that CFI may not be a reliable defense against memory corruption vulnerabilities.
We further evaluate shadow stacks in combination with CFI and find that their presence for security is nec- essary: deploying shadow stacks removes arbitrary code execution capabilities of attackers in three of six cases.
