4. [ ] Kai, Marionette: A Programmable Network Traffic Obfuscation System

Recently, a number of obfuscation systems have been developed to aid in censorship circumvention scenarios where encrypted network traffic is filtered. In this paper, we present Marionette, the first programmable network traffic obfuscation system capable of simultaneously controlling encrypted traffic features at a variety of levels, including ciphertext formats, stateful protocol semantics, and statistical properties. The behavior of the system is directed by a powerful type of probabilistic automata and specified in a user-friendly domain-specific language, which allows the user to easily adjust their obfuscation strategy to meet the unique needs of their network environment. In fact, the Marionette system is capable of emulating many existing obfuscation systems, and enables developers to explore a breadth of protocols and depth of traffic features that have, so far, been unattainable. We evaluate Marionette through a series of case studies inspired by censor capabilities demonstrated in the real-world and research literature, including passive network monitors, stateful proxies, and active probing. The results of our experiments not only show that Marionette provides outstanding flexibility and control over traffic features, but it is also capable of achieving throughput of up to 6:7Mbps when generating RFCcompliant cover traffic.

5. [ ] Changting, "Control-Flow Bending: On the Effectiveness of Control-Flow Integrity"

Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) is a defense which pre- vents control-flow hijacking attacks. While recent re- search has shown that coarse-grained CFI does not stop attacks, fine-grained CFI is believed to be secure. 
We argue that assessing the effectiveness of practi- cal CFI implementations is non-trivial and that common evaluation metrics fail to do so. We then evaluate fully- precise static CFI — the most restrictive CFI policy that does not break functionality — and reveal limitations in its security. Using a generalization of non-control-data attacks which we call Control-Flow Bending (CFB), we show how an attacker can leverage a memory corruption vulnerability to achieve Turing-complete computation on memory using just calls to the standard library. We use this attack technique to evaluate fully-precise static CFI on six real binaries and show that in five out of six cases, powerful attacks are still possible. Our results suggest that CFI may not be a reliable defense against memory corruption vulnerabilities.
We further evaluate shadow stacks in combination with CFI and find that their presence for security is nec- essary: deploying shadow stacks removes arbitrary code execution capabilities of attackers in three of six cases.
