introduction:
     This  paper mainly focused on the security threat of cross-origin communication using postMessage mechanism in HTML5 websites,especially
 in websites that include third-party content.
 The authours collected postMessage receivers from Alexa top 10,000 websites and found that many performed origin checks incorrectly or 
 not at all.This resulted in vulnerabilities in 84 popular sites,including cross-site scripting and injection of arbitrary content into 
 local storage.They also proposed some defenses.The defense for the third-party uses  nonce as a token to authenticate the source of messages.
 The defense for site owners extends Content Security Policy(CSP)  to confine the web resources.
