1. [ ] Lin "Trends and Lessons from Three Years Fighting Malicious Extensions" 
In this work we expose wide-spread efforts by crimi- nals to abuse the Chrome Web Store as a platform for distributing malicious extensions. A central compo- nent of our study is the design and implementation of WebEval, the first system that broadly identifies mali- cious extensions with a concrete, measurable detection rate of 96.5%. Over the last three years we detected 9,523 malicious extensions: nearly 10% of every ex- tension submitted to the store. Despite a short window of operation—we removed 50% of malware within 25 minutes of creation— a handful of under 100 extensions escaped immediate detection and infected over 50 mil- lion Chrome users. Our results highlight that the exten- sion abuse ecosystem is drastically different from ma- licious binaries: miscreants profit from web traffic and user tracking rather than email spam or banking theft.
