4. [ ] Kai, The Design and Implementation of Open vSwitch
We describe the design and implementation of Open vSwitch, a multi-layer, open source virtual switch for all major hypervisor platforms. Open vSwitch was designed de novo for networking in virtual environments, resulting in major design departures from traditional software switching architectures. We detail the advanced flow classification and caching techniques that Open vSwitch uses to optimize its operations and conserve hypervisor resources. We evaluate Open vSwitch performance, drawing from our deployment experiences over the past seven years of using and improving Open vSwitch.
