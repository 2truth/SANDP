# Vandalism Detection in Wikidata

> best paper in CIKM 2016

# Introduction
Wikidata is the new, large scale knowledge base of Wikimedia Foundation, and is increasingly
used within Wikipedia itself and other information system. The crowdsourced wikidata frequently
gets vandalized, exposing all information system using it to the risk of spreading vandalized
and falsified information. In this paper, the authors proposed a new machine learning method
for vandalism detection in Wikidata. More specifically, their model is based on a set of 47
features that quantified the characteristics of Wikidata, as well as Wikidata editis.

# Thinking
I think the authors did very solid work in this paper. First, they analysed almost all the features
of the Wikidata, which I think is complicated. Second, they used a relatively new machine learning
method, Multi-instance learning. Third, they provided a Wikidata Vandalism Corpus.
