While whitehat seo is encouraged, search engine providers want to disrupt blackhat seo, which usually promotes malicious websites. This paper investagates a novel blackhat technique called spider pool. Spider pools use SEO domains resolvded by wildcard dns to increase access frequency of promoted websites from search engine crawlers.
The authors infiltrated to a real-world spider pool provider and found some features: 
1. spider pools generate fabricated subdomain and resovle thme through wildcard dns.
2. the toolkit generates seo page content with long tail keyword and  popular text.
3. spider domains connect to each other. customers' sited are also connected to each pool.

The authors leverage these features to  launch dns scanning and  build a seo domain detector, whose false positive rate for all domains is only 0.8%.
The measurement shows that the distribution of spider pools' ip address and owners concentrate in a few point and that most promoted sites contain illegal information.

One limitation is that adversaries can improve their spider pools' structure to avoid detecting.
